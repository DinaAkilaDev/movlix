Campion is in full control of her material, digging deep into the turbulent inner life of each of her characters with unerring subtlety.";}i:3;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"91";s:3:"url";s:98:"https://theplaylist.net/power-of-the-dog-jane-campion-benedict-cumberbatch-venice-review-20210902/";s:9:"publisher";s:12:"The Playlist";s:6:"author";s:13:"Tomris Laffly";s:6:"review";s:105:"It’s cinematic poetry, if there ever was one, bourgeoning in meaning the more you linger in its shadow.";}i:4;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"85";s:3:"url";s:113:"https://www.thewrap.com/the-power-of-the-dog-film-review-jane-campion-kirsten-dunst-benedict-cumberbatch-netflix/";s:9:"publisher";s:7:"TheWrap";s:6:"author";s:14:"Carlos Aguilar";s:6:"review";s:358:"For a movie that appears to stop and start as it shifts its focus a few times too many, denying us longer introspection into its most magnetic man-to-man rapport, The Power of the Dog thrives on having actors so submerged in the fiction that they are creating a reality. Their subcutaneous labor translates what’s unsaid into fleeting but telling gestures.";}i:5;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"83";s:3:"url";s:121:"https://thefilmstage.com/venice-review-jane-campions-psychosexual-western-the-power-of-the-dog-has-an-irrepressible-bite/";s:9:"publisher";s:14:"The Film Stage";s:6:"author";s:10:"David Katz";s:6:"review";s:191:"The Power of the Dog has attributes that recall her past work but pleasingly seems––if not a new direction––that Campion is drawing upon a fresh skillset to best do this tale justice.";}i:6;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"80";s:3:"url";s:122:"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/02/the-power-of-the-dog-review-jane-campion-benedict-cumberbatch-western-netflix";s:9:"publisher";s:12:"The Guardian";s:6:"author";s:10:"Xan Brooks";s:6:"review";s:180:"It’s a brawny, brooding drama about the wreckage caused by men, beautifully framed in muted neutral tones as the camera circles the ranch-house with a deliberate, stealthy tread.";}i:7;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"80";s:3:"url";s:86:"https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-power-of-the-dog-venice-review/5162918.article";s:9:"publisher";s:12:"Screen Daily";s:6:"author";s:15:"Jonathan Romney";s:6:"review";s:253:"If The Power Of The Dog isn’t the absolute killer coup that Campionites might have hoped, this is her most thoroughly conceived, consistently involving drama for years: taken all in all, pretty much the full visual, dramatic and, indeed sonic package.";}i:8;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"80";s:3:"url";s:85:"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/09/the-power-of-the-dog-movie-review-venice";s:9:"publisher";s:11:"Vanity Fair";s:6:"author";s:14:"Richard Lawson";s:6:"review";s:341:"While the core narrative is plenty compelling in all its creeping dread and curiosity, The Power of the Dog is not too concerned with being about any one thing. The film’s secrets are revealed while new ones bloom into being. Life tumbles after life in the ecosystem of all of us, seething amid the dust clouds we can’t help but kick up.";}i:9;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"70";s:3:"url";s:139:"https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-power-of-the-dog-review-jane-campion-benedict-cumberbatch-kirsten-dunst-jesse-plemons-1235054229/";s:9:"publisher";s:7:"Variety";s:6:"author";s:15:"Owen Gleiberman";s:6:"review";s:302:"All of this should build, slowly and inexorably, in force and emotion. But for a film that’s actually, at heart, rather tidy and old-fashioned in its triangular gamesmanship, “The Power of the Dog” needed to get to a more bruising catharsis. In its crucial last act, the film becomes too oblique.";}}
